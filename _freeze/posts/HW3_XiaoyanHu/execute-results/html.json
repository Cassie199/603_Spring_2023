United Nations (Data file: UN11in alr4) The data in the file UN11 contains several variables,\nincluding ppgdp, the gross national product per person in U.S. dollars, and fertility, the birth\nrate per 1000 females, both from the year 2009. The data are for 199 localities, mostly UN\nmember countries, but also other areas such as Hong Kong that are not independent countries.\nThe data were collected from the United Nations (2011). We will study the dependence of\nfertility on ppgdp.\n(a) Identify the predictor and the response.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(UN11)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                region  group fertility   ppgdp lifeExpF pctUrban\nAfghanistan       Asia  other     5.968   499.0    49.49       23\nAlbania         Europe  other     1.525  3677.2    80.40       53\nAlgeria         Africa africa     2.142  4473.0    75.00       67\nAngola          Africa africa     5.135  4321.9    53.17       59\nAnguilla     Caribbean  other     2.000 13750.1    81.10      100\nArgentina   Latin Amer  other     2.172  9162.1    79.89       93\n```\n:::\n:::\n\npredictor is ppgdp and response is fertility and birth rate. \n\n(b) Draw the scatterplot of fertility on the vertical axis versus ppgdp on the horizontal axis\nand summarize the information in this graph.

Does\nthe simple linear regression model seem plausible for a summary of this graph? If you use\na different base of logarithms, the shape of the graph won’t change, but the values on the\naxes will change.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(UN11, aes(ppgdp, fertility)) +\n  geom_point()+scale_y_log10()+scale_x_log10()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_XiaoyanHu_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n# Question 2\nAnnual income, in dollars, is an explanatory variable in a regression analysis. For a British\nversion of the report on the analysis, all responses are converted to British pounds sterling (1 pound\nequals about 1.33 dollars, as of 2016).\n(a) How, if at all, does the slope of the prediction equation change?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(b) How, if at all, does the correlation change?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n# Question 3\nWater runoff in the Sierras (Data file: water in alr4) Can Southern California’s water\nsupply in future years be predicted from past data? One factor affecting water availability is stream\nrunoff. If runoff could be predicted, engineers, planners, and policy makers could do their jobs\n\nmore efficiently. The data file contains 43 years’ worth of precipitation measurements taken at six\nsites in the Sierra Nevada mountains (labeled APMAM, APSAB, APSLAKE, OPBPC, OPRC, and\nOPSLAKE) and stream runoff volume at a site near Bishop, California, labeled BSAAM. Draw\nthe scatterplot matrix for these data and summarize the information available from these\nplots. (Hint: Use the pairs() function.)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n# Question 4\nProfessor ratings (Data file: Rateprof in alr4) In the website and online forum\nRateMyProfessors.com, students rate and comment on their instructors. Launched in 1999, the site\nincludes millions of ratings on thousands of instructors. The data file includes the summaries of\nthe ratings of 364 instructors at a large campus in the Midwest (Bleske-Rechek and Fritsch, 2011).\nEach instructor included in the data had at least 10 ratings over a several year period. Students\nprovided ratings of 1–5 on quality, helpfulness, clarity, easiness of instructor’s courses, and\nraterInterest in the subject matter covered in the instructor’s courses. The data file provides the\naverages of these five ratings. Create a scatterplot matrix of these five variables. Provide a\nbrief description of the relationships between the five ratings.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n# Question 5\nFor the student.survey data file in the smss package, conduct regression analyses relating\n(by convention, y denotes the outcome variable, x denotes the explanatory variable)\n(i) y = political ideology and x = religiosity,\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(ii) y = high school GPA and x = hours of TV watching.\n(You can use ?student.survey in the R console, after loading the package, to see what each variable\nmeans.)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(a) Graphically portray how the explanatory variable relates to the outcome variable in\neach of the two cases\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n(b) Summarize and interpret results of inferential analyses.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
